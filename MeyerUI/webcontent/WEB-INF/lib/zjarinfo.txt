The names of the jar files in WEB-INF/lib do not contain a version information
in order to simplify the delivey of updated jar files. The list below contains
the exact version information on each file.

iText-2.1.7
jsf-api-2.2.14
jsf-impl-2.2.14
jstl-api-1.2
log4j-1.2.17
xercesImpl-2.11.0

Some libraries may be listed twice - one version having a size of 1kByte. In this
case we update the corresponding jar file and deliver the previous version as
dummy file so that it overwrites the file in case of copying and posting.
